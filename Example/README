Compilation instructions (on linux)
With R already installed (along with dependencies RcppEigen, geometry, rgl, Matrix, plot3D and plot3Drgl) it is enough to run from the terminal the following two commands (in the folder containing the dowloaded fdaPDE repository):

$ R CMD build fdaPDE
$ R CMD INSTALL fdaPDE_1.1-0.tar.gz

Compilation instructions (on windows)
From within R use the following command (update path to downloaded repository):
install.packages("/path/to/fdaPDE/folder", type="source", repos=NULL)

Due to some annoying issues with RcppEigen the compiler used to issue a lot of warnings during compilation. These have been hidden adding a one-line Makevars file in folder src containing the following:
PKG_CXXFLAGS = -Wno-ignored-attributes

Unfortunately it seems unlikely that this solution can be permanently added to the library because of CRAN constraints.
